# Software Developer at Neoception

As a junior software developer at Neoception, I focused on web application development while learning modern development practices in a collaborative environment. I built responsive web applications using modern frameworks, implemented user interfaces from design mockups, and developed cross-platform solutions for multiple devices.

Throughout my time at Neoception, I gained proficiency in JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, learned modern development workflows and best practices, and participated in code reviews and team collaboration. I successfully completed a comprehensive development program, delivered multiple web applications from concept to deployment, achieved comprehensive code coverage in testing practices, and gained proficiency in modern development tools and methodologies.
