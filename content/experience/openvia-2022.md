# Frontend Engineer at Openvia

As a Frontend Engineer at Openvia, I led modern web application development with React and TypeScript, focusing on full-stack development from concept to deployment with scalable architecture and optimal user experience. I worked with cutting-edge technologies including React and TypeScript for modern component-based architecture, Bootstrap and custom CSS for responsive design systems, and GraphQL & REST APIs for efficient data fetching and state management.

My key achievements included delivering multiple major projects from conception to production, achieving significant performance improvements through code optimization and best practices, maintaining comprehensive code coverage with testing, and implementing zero-downtime deployments using advanced CI/CD strategies. I also mentored junior developers, established code review standards that improved team code quality, and contributed to agile process improvements that increased team velocity.
