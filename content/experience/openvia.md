# Frontend Engineer at Openvia

As a Frontend Engineer at Openvia, I led the development of modern web applications and enterprise solutions, focusing on scalable architecture and optimal user experience. I was responsible for building responsive React and Next.js applications, implementing RESTful and GraphQL APIs.

My key achievements included delivering multiple major projects, improving application performance across legacy systems, and maintaining high uptime for production systems. Set up CI/CD pipelines, and implemented performance monitoring that reduced development time through reusable components.
